## Key Features

- **Telegram Bot Integration**:  
  Interact with the bot through simple commands like `/start` and `/newbot`.  
  Real-time responses via Telegram BotFather API.

- **Serverless and Scalable Architecture**:  
  AWS Lambda for event-driven computation.  
  API Gateway for routing and REST API management.

- **Webhook Support**:  
  Securely integrates Telegram updates via webhook endpoints.

- **Cloud Monitoring**:  
  Tracks performance and logs events with AWS CloudWatch.

## Technologies Used

1. **Telegram Bot API**: For creating the bot interface and managing interactions.
2. **AWS API Gateway**: Handles routing of API requests and ensures scalability.
3. **AWS Lambda**: Processes backend logic for URL shortening and responses.
4. **AWS CloudWatch**: Provides logging and monitoring for troubleshooting and debugging.

## How It Works

1. **Telegram Commands**:  
   Users interact with the bot using commands:  
   - `/start`: Displays available services.  
   - `/newbot`: Initializes a new bot instance.

2. **API Gateway**:  
   Processes requests from Telegramâ€™s webhook and routes them to Lambda.

3. **Lambda Functionality**:  
   Executes URL shortening and management logic.  
   Sends responses back to Telegram through the webhook.

4. **Webhook Integration**:  
   The bot uses a secure webhook endpoint hosted on API Gateway to receive updates from Telegram.
